## Project Overview
This project is a photo blog web application developed to consolidate key concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features a cork board layout where each photo is styled like a polaroid, dynamically loaded via API, and enhanced with interactive animations and overlays. 
The focus was on mastering responsive grid layouts, CSS positioning, DOM manipulation, and layered visual effects.

## Features

- **Cork Board Display**: Photos are arranged on a cork board using CSS Grid for responsive layout.
- **Polaroid Styling**: Each photo is styled with a white frame, a red pushpin (positioned with `absolute`), and a caption.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Photos are fetched from an external API and inserted into the layout using JavaScript.
- **Overlay Effect**: Clicking a photo opens a full-size view with a darkened background and close button.
- **Animated Entry**: Each photo appears with a falling animation using CSS keyframes.
- **Layer Management**: Elements are visually layered using `z-index` for realistic stacking.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Grid layout, absolute/relative positioning, z-index, animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and dynamic rendering
